### üìÅ **How to Use**

This script is designed to work with Omarchy's theme structure.

#### **Step 1: Create the 'live' Folder**

Inside your active Omarchy theme's `backgrounds` directory, create a new folder named `live`.

**Example Path:**
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/YOUR_THEME/backgrounds/live/`

#### **Step 2: Add and Name Your Videos**

Place your video wallpaper files (`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, etc.) inside the `live` folder you just created.

To define the cycle order, you **must** name your files with a number prefix.

**Correct Naming Convention:**
- `1-my-cool-video.mp4`
- `2-another-one.webm`
- `10-final-video.mov`

#### **Step 3: Toggle Your Live Wallpaper**

Use the shortcut **`Super + Ctrl + W`**:
-   **First press:** Activates the `1-...` video.
-   **Second press:** Cycles to the `2-...` video.
-   **After the last video:** Deactivates the live wallpaper and restores your static wallpaper.
